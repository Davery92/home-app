# Family Management App - Tasks & Improvements

## 🚨 High Priority Bug Fixes

### Calendar Issues
- [✅] **Calendar Event Editing**: You can't edit events in the calendar 
- [ ] **Event Date Duplication**: Created an event and it appeared on two days
- [✅] **Auto-populate Old Event Name**: When creating a new calendar event, the old event's name pops up requiring deletion
- [✅] **Date Auto-selection**: When you click on a day to add an event, it should automatically change the date to the day you clicked
- [✅] **Remove Priority Field**: Don't need priority field when adding a calendar event

### Text Visibility Issues (Dark Mode)
- [✅] **To-Do Text**: Once a to-do is created, it has black writing so you can't see it
- [✅] **Pet Names**: Under pet care center, the dogs' names are white text in a white box - can't see their names
- [✅] **Grocery Text**: Groceries have black on black writing - visibility issue

### Form Issues
- [ ] **Cleaning Task Assignment**: Under cleaning, you add a task and it says assignee but you can't assign anyone & it won't let you create a task without assigning someone
- [✅] **To-Do Button Text**: In to-do, the "add to do" button needs a space between "to" and "do" and a space in the title spot

## 🔧 Feature Improvements

  - Amanda's work
